/**
 * The schema and navigation lanes of a tracker room, for a browser host.
 *
 * `BrowserTrackerDataSource` carries items and saved views; it takes the other
 * two lanes as hooks because their storage is the host's business. On desktop
 * they land in PGLite tables and the workspace's YAML files. A browser tab has
 * neither, and it does not need either: both lanes are small, both bootstrap
 * from the room on every connect, and nothing in this host originates a change
 * to them. So they live in memory, and a reload replays them.
 *
 * This is deliberately read-only. Creating a folder, renaming a tracker, or
 * editing a type definition is a desktop action -- `listUnsynced` returns
 * nothing, so this host never pushes into either lane and never has a local
 * change the server could refuse.
 *
 * Two things make the schema lane more than "parse the JSON":
 *
 *  - An override of a **builtin** arrives as a delta against the sender's
 *    builtin seed, never as a full model (#1178). It has to be resolved against
 *    *this* build's builtin, which is why the builtins are parsed here rather
 *    than assumed present.
 *  - Shared selectors read `globalRegistry`, not this store --
 *    `trackerCollections`, the grid's column derivation, the status-category
 *    lookups. Resolved models are registered there as well, exactly as the
 *    desktop schema service does, or the surfaces render a room whose types
 *    they cannot see.
 *
 * A **personal** tracker type never lands in either place. Its items live in
 * the author's own workspace and no room carries them, so projecting one here
 * would offer a selectable tracker that is permanently empty -- which reads as
 * a sync that failed, not as a tracker that was never the team's. The builtin
 * personal types are excluded at construction and an inbound definition that
 * resolves to `sharing: 'personal'` is refused, so the exclusion holds however
 * the type arrives.
